# Modify solve_T_S -> rhs.py : DONE
# Modify seaicemodelstefan_validation as OOP: DONE
# add Fourier time step condition
# Coefficients.py need to work from start
# Plotting conditions: add node step variations

# changes in seaicemodelstefan_validation:
# 1. create advection_diffusion of solve_T_S.py object : DONE
# 

# skipped since not relevant to current work
# 1. rhs.py -> correct for brine movement


# constants real scripts: Updated every script with userinput.constants : DONE
# 1. coefficients.py
# 2. initial_boundary_conditions.py
# 3. liquid_fraction.py
# 4. rhs.py
# 5. solve_T_S.py
# 6. StefanProblem.py

# create df with : idea scrapped
# 


# Interesting to investigate: 
# Initial_boundary_conditions-> T = np.ones(nz, dtype=np.float64) * Tm_w #T_air_Stefan. Why Tm_w constant for constants_real as well? look for real value. 
#                               Replacing Tm_w with T_air_Stefan gave bad convergence for constants_debug

# possible bug : depth did not change as it discontinued from the loop when phi[i]<0.01.
#               When T_IC=T_air_Stefan : numerical interface depth remained 1.5m during the whole simulation
# ice_depth->L38: break->continue
